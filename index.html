  <h1>The Super Duper Awesome Mightycookie Game with Cutting Edge Graphics and Technolgoy that is Sure to Revolutionize the World!</h1>

  <p>Below you will find my Pixel Art to be used in my upcoming game "The Super Duper Awesome Mightycookie Game with Cutting Edge Graphics and Technolgoy that is Sure to Revolutionize the World!" The goal of the game is to clear through levels of space while in control of the Mightycookie ship. Your enemies are the evil, pesky, ugly POE-TAE-TOES. It is your duty, as a bringer of sugary smiles to kids all over the world, to rid them of the PLAGUE that are these starchy pests (and in the process take the kids teeth as well. They dont need those. As you know, these days we only eat liquid food. It helped scientists to not have to actually make it look real when it got fabricated in some lab. As a liquid they can just focus on the taste, nutrients, and whatever drugs the government wants to drop in there to make us dependent and unstable (like sugar, corn syrup, or caffeine). But none of that matters. Go, hero. Be courageous. Be wise. And, above all, be Mighty. </p>

    These are the gem-bullets. We have no use for them back on Earth. Nobody wants to attract attention these days. Not with the way everyone looks. . . .
